# Advent Of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is like a geeky holiday tradition for programmers, where we count down the days to Christmas by solving daily coding challenges that are trickier than untangling a ball of Christmas lights. It's a month of coffee-fueled coding, debugging marathons, and laughter at the sheer absurdity of some of the problems. Picture programmers huddled in blankets, battling code like it's a snowstorm, all while dreaming of that glorious leaderboard victory. It's the perfect mix of festive cheer and algorithmic madness, making every coder's December a little more joyful and a lot more nerdy! ðŸŽ…ðŸ’»ðŸŽ„

## Problems

Advent of Code problems are laid out in a directory structure matching:

```
/problems/{Y}/Day {d} - Example/problem.md
/problems/{Y}/Day {d} - Example/input.{txt,bin}
```

The goal of this directory structure is to encapsulate problems for AoC from their solutions.

## Solutions

The solutions directory is setup to allow multiple solution attempts at the same problems. The naming convention is `{Y}{m}{d}-solution-name`. Each solution has its own development environment and `README.md` for how to get started.
