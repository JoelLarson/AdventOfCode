# Solution: Ruby TDD

Date Started: 2023-12-03

## Summary

My goal with this solution is to practice [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) to start re-applying it in my professional life. As with any useful skill, it requires constant practice to stay fluent in it.

The following rules are applied when writing these solutions:

* Tests must be written and fail before writing production code
* The least amount of brain cells should be engaged when writing code that passes the tests
* Only behaviors can be tested (no implementation testing)
